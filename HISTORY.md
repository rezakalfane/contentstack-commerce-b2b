## 5 October

### 1. How to build a storefront on Contentstack
**Prompt:** "I have a ContentStack stack with an API key as well as a Management key. How can I build a storefront and get content from ContentStack?"

**Result:** Explained the credential model: the stack **API key** identifies the stack, a **delivery token** (read-only,
bound to one environment) is what a storefront uses, and the **management token** is only for writing content (seeding,
automation) and must never reach the browser. Recommended Next.js with `@contentstack/delivery-sdk`, and noted that a
commerce backend is needed for catalog, cart and checkout.

### 2. Credentials arrive (labels only)
**Prompt:** Pasted the labels "Stack API Key / Delivery Token / Preview Token" (no values).

**Result:** Scaffolded `storefront/` with `create-next-app` (TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind) and installed the
Contentstack SDKs. Values were deliberately kept out of the chat.

### 3. "Can you name the environment variable I should create?"
**Result:** Created `.env.local` with `CONTENTSTACK_API_KEY`, `CONTENTSTACK_DELIVERY_TOKEN`, `CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW_TOKEN`,
`CONTENTSTACK_ENVIRONMENT`, `CONTENTSTACK_REGION` and the client in `lib/contentstack.ts`. No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix, so
tokens stay server-side.

### 4. "filled"
**Result:** Verified the credentials against the Delivery API and listed the content types the stack already had
(`page`, `hero_banner`, `author`, `blog_landing_page`, `blog_listing_page`: Contentstack's starter model).

### 5. "You can use my first BigCommerce store with the products of a channel named after the second"
**Result:** Loaded the BigCommerce admin skill, listed configured environments (names only) and found that the
first store has **no** channel with that name; the name belongs to a separate store. Asked which was meant.

### 6. Choosing the source
**Answer:** the second store (the one with the headless storefront channel).
**Result:** Listed its channels (a Stencil channel, one active headless storefront channel, several terminated/deleted ones) and its
catalog summary (150 products, car batteries first).

### 7. Channel and token
**Prompt:** "Channel is <the headless one>. ok with the process. Can we also populate ContentStack with authors, blog listing page and blog landing pages?"

**Result:** Created a **channel-scoped Storefront API token** (localhost origin, 90 days) and wrote it to `.env.local`
without printing it. Contentstack seeding was blocked on a management token, so a placeholder variable was added.

### 8. Authors, 36 posts and the blog listing
**Prompt:** "updated management token, please create a handful of authors, blog posts about generic b2b commerce topics with the blog listing page and publish. let's make 6 authors with 6 blog posts each, so 36 blog posts"

**Result:** Wrote the idempotent seed (`scripts/seed/seed.py`): 6 fictional authors, 36 articles across six themes
(pricing, buyer experience, integrations, payments, sales, headless), a hero banner and the listing page, all published.
**Findings along the way:** the stack is in the **EU region** with a single environment named **`preview`** (my first
calls used the US host and failed); `featured_image` and `picture` are required file fields so images had to be
generated; the `widget.type` field is an enum (`Blog Archive` / `Related Posts`); publishing a *localized* entry needs a
top-level `locale` in the request body.

### 9. Screenshot: Live Preview shows a 404
**Prompt:** (Screenshot of a blog entry in Contentstack with Live Preview showing "404".)

**Result:** The storefront only had the scaffold home page. Built `/blog` and `/blog/[slug]`, the data layer
(`lib/blog.ts`), JSON-RTE-to-HTML rendering and Live Preview (`livePreviewQuery`, preview host per region).

### 10. Screenshot: the blog listing entry also 404s
**Result:** Same cause, fixed by the same routes.

### 11. "Can you creatively create new useful schemas and use them to create entries for our site?"
**Result:** Designed content types for a B2B site: **FAQ**, **Buying guide**, **Product spotlight**, **Announcement
bar**, **Site navigation** (and a Case study type, later removed). Wrote the schema builder (`schemas.py`), the entry
data (`content_extra.py`) and seeds. Hit the **free-plan limit of 10 content types**, which shaped decision 15.

### 12. Screenshot: hero heading overlaps itself
**Result:** The generated hero image had the title baked in, so the headline was drawn twice. Replaced it with a
text-free background and renamed the hero entry to its real headline.

### 13. "Rename the placeholder site name to Commerce B2B"
**Result:** Renamed in the layout and home page.

### 14. Screenshot: the starter "Contentstack Kickstart" page entry
**Result:** The home page was hard-coded. Rewrote the starter `page` entry (URL `/`) into real home content and made
the home route render from it.

### 15. "Navigation is important so maybe we can remove Case Study, or choose what's more important: Case Study or FAQ?"
**Result:** Chose to keep **FAQ** (answers real buyer questions, referenced by guides) and delete the **empty**
`case_study` type to free a slot for `site_navigation`. Navigation, announcement bar and footer are now CMS-driven.

### 16. Screenshot: "not seeing product images, and contentstack images, buying guides page also needs its own hero banner, FAQ as well"
**Result:** Product cards now use live BigCommerce photos and prices via the Storefront GraphQL API (channel-specific
host). Replaced gradient placeholders with composed product photos. Added a `hero` reference to the `page` type and
created `/faq` and `/guides` page entries, each with its own hero banner entry.

### 17. "product prices are no more hidden for guests"
**Result:** Confirmed guests receive prices from the Storefront API and show them on all product cards.

### 18-19. Screenshots: "make FAQ same page width as the other pages" / "guide page width should be the same as home page. All pages should have the same width"
**Result:** Standardised every page on one container width. Detail pages (guide, post) use a main column plus a sidebar
instead of stretching text. (Later superseded by the 1100px `.page` container, see 24.)

### 20. "You can use images (without titles) from pilesbatteries.com. We also need a nice product detail page"
**Result:** Reviewed the site's imagery, kept the nine text-free photos (cars, motorcycles, chargers, tools,
batteries, solar, a plug) and excluded banners with baked-in text. Built the **product detail page** (gallery, price,
stock, key specs, volume pricing, description, spec table, related guides and products, JSON-LD), the **product
list**, the **cart** and **add-to-cart** (server action + BigCommerce cart mutations). Verified cart create/add/read/remove
against the real store once.

### 21. "I need the whole site to be multi-language. I've defined an additional fr-FR locale (will need a base URL for that), and we need to translate our ContentStack entries in French"
**Result:** Implemented locale routing (`proxy.ts`, `app/[locale]/…`): English at clean URLs, French under `/fr`.
Locale-aware fetchers with fallback to English, a UI dictionary, hreflang metadata, a language switcher and
locale-aware prices and dates. The "base URL" is the **per-locale Live Preview base URL** in Contentstack settings
(`http://localhost:3000` for en-us, `http://localhost:3000/fr` for fr-fr).

### 22. Screenshot: Visual Editor "Can't resolve './globals.css'"
**Result:** A transient error from moving the layout into `app/[locale]/` mid-edit; resolved by the new layout.

### 23. "We'll need to translate ContentStack entries"
**Result:** Wrote French translations of all content (36 posts, 6 bios, 15 FAQs, guides, spotlights, navigation,
banners, pages) and `seed_fr.py`, which localizes and publishes each entry as `fr-fr`. 77 entries published at that point.

### 24. "Using your best design skill, update the storefront style with a nice light theme, 1100px max page width, better pictures on the homepage"
**Result:** Redesigned as **Workbench**: light, cool steel and blue-black ink with one battery-terminal amber accent,
Archivo (condensed display) + IBM Plex Sans, photography-led home page (staggered photo pair, category mosaic), open
product tiles instead of bordered cards, dark footer. Documented in `docs/design-system.md`.

## 6 October

### 25. Screenshot: "buying guides deserves better pictures from pilesbatteries as well, I don't like the banners with product images"
**Result:** Guide hero images are now site photography instead of composed product shots. Fixed the seeder so a changed
image under an existing filename **replaces the asset in place** (it had been silently reusing the old file).

### 26. "Create a HISTORY.md … update the main README.md … create docs/*.md files"
**Result:** This file, the README and the `docs/` folder.

### 27. Screenshot: duplicate React key error in Visual Editor
**Result:** The preview API can return an entry twice. De-duplicated by `uid` in the data layer.

### 28. Screenshot: "can you put a nice editable image in the second box as well?"
**Result:** The second hero photo (the `image` field of the home page) now has an edit tag, so it can be changed
inline in Visual Editor; the seed gives it a real photo instead of the old placeholder.

### 29. "Should be easy to create product listing page as well and a mega menu for products, all coming from BigCommerce and localized."
**Result:** Product listing (`/products`, `/products/<category>`) with sort, brand and price filters from BigCommerce
facets, and a **mega menu** built from the live category tree, with photos, subcategories, counts and French labels.

### 30. "When no product for a category, list sub-categories products"
**Result:** A category's own product list is often empty. Categories now use faceted search by category ID, which
includes all subcategory products (Automotive Batteries lists 38).

### 31. "List 8 facet values max. Select 3 additional facets with good products representation"
**Result:** Measured attribute coverage across the 150 products and added **Technology (93%)**, **Voltage (89%)** and
**Warranty (66%)** facets. Every facet, brand included, shows at most 8 values (selected values always stay visible).

### 32. Screenshot: Live Preview SDK error "Failed to send page context to Visual Builder" (Timeline mode)
**Result:** Replaced `setPageContext` (which posts a message and expects an acknowledgement) with the documented
`<meta name="contentstack:entry-uid">` tags, which need no builder frame.

### 33. "Can you add 3 more nice & localized buying guides?"
**Result:** Added guides for deep-cycle batteries (gel / AGM / dual-purpose), chargers and jump starters, and
motorcycle batteries, in English and French, each recommending real catalog products.

### 34. "Can we automatically apply filters on click and move the Clear filter action at the top"
**Result:** Filters apply as you click (no Apply button), without a page reload or scroll jump. "Clear all" sits in
the toolbar at the top.

### 35. "Also add search as you type (3 char min) and when entering a search, it's added as a filter you can remove (gets cleared on clear filters action)"
**Result:** Search-as-you-type from 3 characters (hint below that), shown as a removable chip, cleared by "Clear all".

### 36. "Add a nice dynamic quantity chooser in the cart"
**Result:** Stepper (− / typeable / +) with instant totals, debounced save to BigCommerce, rollback on error. Verified in
a real browser, including persistence after reload.

### 37. "Enable live editing with sync when we edit the form" and "Read the Visual Editor setup docs … to enable inline editing"
**Result:** Read the Contentstack docs and the SDK reference. Enabled `mode: "builder"`, SSR live sync, `data-cslp` edit
tags on the key fields of every page type (headlines, images, rich text, steps, cards), entry context via meta tags and
a CSP `frame-ancestors` rule. See `docs/live-preview-and-visual-editor.md`.

### 38. Review pass (no prompt): contrast and mobile
**Result:** Measured the palette's contrast ratios and corrected the docs; changed the guide step numbers from deep amber
(2.3:1 on white) to ink; reviewed phone-width screenshots and made the filter panel start collapsed below 1024 px.

### 39. "Let's deploy on my Vercel and link GitHub repo" (after publishing to GitHub)
**Prompt sequence:** the repository was created first ("repository should be rezakalfane/contentstack-commerce-b2b, public"),
then "let's deploy on my Vercel and link GitHub repo", "BC store: have them genericized" and "set vercel environment variables if not yet done".

**Result:**
- **GitHub:** public repo `rezakalfane/contentstack-commerce-b2b`. Before pushing, scanned every file for secrets (none), asked
  which commit email to publish (the user chose a personal address; the work address never reached the remote), and
  committed `.env.example`, which the `.env*` ignore rule had swallowed.
- **Genericized** the BigCommerce store name and channel ID in the docs, README, HISTORY and code comments, and squashed the
  history so the identifiers do not remain in any commit (the repo was minutes old, with no forks).
- **Vercel:** created the project, connected the GitHub repo (pushes to `main` deploy to production), set the 8 storefront
  variables for Production and Preview (tokens sensitive, management token deliberately excluded) and deployed.
- **Verified live:** pages in both languages, live prices and facets, redirects, security header, all images, and the cart
  flow end to end. No console errors.

### 40. "Add screenshots and crops where it makes more sense in the docs. Tell me if you need me to capture some Contentstack pages"
**Result:** Captured 19 storefront images from the live site (listing with filters, filter sidebar, mega menu, product page and
details, cart, guide, FAQ, blog post, home sections, English/French comparison), plus a rendered **architecture diagram**
(editable source in `docs/images/source/`), a colour palette and typography/component sheets. Embedded them in the README
(gallery) and in `architecture`, `implementation`, `design-system`, `i18n` and `bigcommerce` docs. A script checks that no image
link is broken. The Contentstack and Live Editor screens need to come from the user (the app is behind a login).

While reading the screenshots the user sent next, noticed a **`production` environment now exists** in Contentstack (Live
Preview base URLs set to the Vercel domain). The docs previously said only `preview` existed; corrected, and documented the
steps to switch the live site over (content is still published only to `preview`).

### 41. "Can I copy/paste prod tokens here?" / "Let's create the production token update and deploy" (and "have you included these screenshots in the right doc?")
**Result:** Advised **against** pasting tokens into the chat. Published all content (80 entries per language, 75 assets) to the
`production` environment with a new reusable script (`publish_environment.py`). Contentstack does not let a management token
create delivery tokens, so the user created a production delivery token and preview token in the app and saved them to a
temporary local file outside the repo; they were verified against the API (new token accepted, a wrong one rejected), copied to
Vercel's **Production scope only** without ever being displayed, and the file deleted. Redeployed and verified: the new
`X-Content-Environment` header changed from `preview` to `production`, 16 pages in both languages and every image work.
Preview deployments and local development still read `preview`. Also rebased onto a README edit made directly on GitHub.

The ten Contentstack screenshots (content types, builder, entries, assets, environments, languages, GraphQL Explorer, Visual
Editor in English and French, guide step) were on the user's Desktop all along; an earlier lookup missed them (a wrong `ls` flag, and
macOS puts a narrow no-break space in the file names). They are now cropped (browser tabs and URL bar removed, since the URL holds
the stack API key) and embedded in the `contentstack`, `live-preview-and-visual-editor`, `i18n` docs and the README.

### 42. "Sure, how are you going to do it?" (review gate), "don't see it", and the workflow screenshots
**Result:** Added an editorial gate between Contentstack `preview` and `production`. The user chose a **Workflow + publishing
rule** and a **public staging URL**. A "Review before live" workflow (Draft, In review, Approved; Approved is Admin-only) covers
all ten content types, and a publishing rule refuses production publishes for entries that are not Approved. It was tested with a
temporary entry: Draft and In review were refused for `production`, allowed for `preview`, and Approved was accepted. All 160
existing entries were baselined to Approved. A `staging` branch is rebuilt from `main` by a GitHub Action (with an empty commit,
because Vercel skips a branch tip it already built); Vercel's SSO protection was disabled for previews so the staging URL opens
without login. A "Deployment is building" placeholder initially returned 200, so checks look at the page title instead. The user
pointed the `preview` environment at the staging URL and added a `local` environment.

Documentation: the workflow got its own page, [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md), with seven screenshots (environments, workflow
scope and stages, publishing rule scope and conditions, Vercel overview and staging deployment). `contentstack`, `operations`,
`seeding`, `decisions` (D27, D28; the open question is closed) and the docs index were updated, with limits stated plainly.

## 7 October (block model)

### Block-composed pages for every CMS
**Prompt:** (while building the switchable project `content-commerce-b2b`) Re-ordering components works great for Pages and Blog in Amplience; can we have the same for the other CMSs?

**Result:** Pages and posts become ordered lists of blocks in every CMS, so editors can reorder, add and remove components without a developer. In Contentstack the `page` content type gets a `components` modular blocks field (`hero`, `feature`, `text`, `image`, `video` and one generic `collection` whose `kind` is `categories`, `spotlights`, `guides`, `posts`, `postListing`, `guideListing` or `faqs`, with `items` references), and the post type `blog_landing_page` gets `content` blocks (text, image, video) and `read_time`. The hero gains `second_image` and `variant`. The blog index becomes a `page` entry (url `/blog`) instead of `blog_listing_page`. They were added **next to** the earlier fixed-layout fields (`tools/contentstack/blocks.py`, additive, both locales).

### Port into this repository (single-CMS build)
**Prompt:** (Port the block model into this repository, single-CMS, the same way as the Storyblok storefront.)

**Result:** The UI, the content model (`core/content.ts`), the proxy and the Contentstack provider come from `content-commerce-b2b`, reduced to Contentstack only: no switcher, no other CMS, no time travel. The data layer is now `providers/cms/contentstack/{client,mapper,index,live-preview,edit-support}` behind the facade `lib/content.ts`; `lib/blog.ts`, `lib/site.ts`, `lib/cslp.ts` and `lib/rte.ts` are gone. The pages are the catch-all `app/[locale]/[...slug]` plus the blog post and guide routes, rendered by `components/page-blocks.tsx`, `page-content.tsx`, `post-view.tsx` and `guide-view.tsx`; the catalog is a static `app/[locale]/products` route with the translated roots rewritten by `proxy.ts` (`x-catalog-root`). `proxy.ts` verifies Live Preview's parameters into trusted `x-preview` and `x-cs-*` headers (removing any a client sent), marks requests framed by Contentstack's app with `x-editor` so the SDK loads on the pane's first request (before a draft hash exists), and sets `frame-ancestors` for Contentstack. `CONTENTSTACK_EDIT_MODE` no longer exists. The seeding scripts moved from `scripts/seed` to `tools/contentstack` (`seed.py`, `seed_extra.py`, `seed_fr.py`, then `blocks.py`; new: `backup.py`, `prune.py`).

### Backup and prune prepared, not run; not deployed
**Result:** The earlier fields (`page.image`, `rich_text`, `blocks`, `hero`; `blog_landing_page.body`, `related_post`, `is_archived`, `comments`, `social_share`) and the `blog_listing_page` and `hero_banner` types are still in the stack; the site no longer reads them. `tools/contentstack/backup.py` (content types and entries to `.backups/`) and `prune.py` (a dry run by default; `--run` removes them and takes the stack from ten content types to eight) are prepared. **The prune has not been run and awaits approval, and the new code has not been deployed yet.** The Contentstack screenshots in `docs/images/cs-*` predate the block model (the earlier Home and the ten-type list); they are kept as they are. The documentation was brought up to date in the same pass.

## Things that did not work the first time (and why it matters)

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `api_key is not valid` | Called the US host; the stack is in the EU region | Region-aware hosts |
| Publishing a localized entry failed | CMA needs a top-level `locale` in the publish body | Added to `seed_fr.py` |
| Field UID rejected | `recommended_product_ids` is reserved | Renamed `recommended_bc_products` |
| Cannot create 11th content type | Free plan caps stacks at 10 types | Removed unused Case Study |
| GraphQL "JWT channel id doesn't match" | Channel-scoped token needs the channel host | `store-<hash>-<channel>.mybigcommerce.com` |
| Product page 404 | Catch-all route dropped the `products/` prefix of the BigCommerce path | Rebuild `/products/<slug>/` |
| Product page 500 | Passed a function from a Server to a Client Component | Pass a string template |
| Changed image not updating | Seeder reused assets by filename | Replace the asset in place |
| Category page empty | Category's own product list excludes subcategories | Faceted search by category |
| Unused GraphQL variable error | Declared `$before` and `$after` together | Declare only the one in use |

### French catalog content from BigCommerce
**Prompt:** BigCommerce categories and products are translated already, so get the right content for the locale (it works in the Catalyst project).

**Result:** The Storefront GraphQL API **ignores `Accept-Language`**; the Catalyst client selects the language with an `@shopperPreferences(locale: "fr")` directive on the operation (short code `fr`; `fr-FR` is not accepted). `gql()` now adds it for non-default locales, so product names and descriptions, categories, custom-field labels and facet values come back translated (151 products, 19 categories and 1,231 custom fields have French in BigCommerce). BigCommerce also translates URL paths and a product path only resolves in its own language, so the shared English slugs (D9) are kept by restoring each `path` from the default-locale catalog by entity id, resolving a product page through its English path and then reading the translated content by id. PDP key specs match on the English field name (`key`), the mega menu matches tiles by path, and cart links use the restored path. Verified on 23 French pages (no translated-path links), filters, the cart flow and English pages unchanged. Ported identically to the ContentStack and Amplience storefronts.

### Translated catalog URLs and a language switcher that finds the matching page
**Result:** Ported from the Storyblok storefront. The catalog routes moved to `app/[locale]/[root]/...` (`CATALOG_ROOT` per language: `/products`, `/fr/produits`), pages resolve BigCommerce's translated paths in the page's language, `locales` feeds hreflang and canonical tags, `/api/switch-locale` redirects a catalog page to its counterpart in the other language (search and sort kept, translated attribute filters dropped), another language's root (`/fr/products/...`) redirects permanently, and the bare `/products` link, tiles and mega menu use translated paths. This replaces the earlier approach that restored English slugs.

### Cart subtotal updated several times
**Prompt:** When adding to cart, the subtotal is updated multiple times (found while building the Contentful version, then ported here).

**Result:** One click on "+" in the cart showed the optimistic total, then the previous server total, then the new one (e.g. £396.80, £198.40, £396.80): when the save ended, the subtotal fell back to the server value in the props, which is still the old one until the refresh lands. `cart-view.tsx` now keeps the optimistic total until fresh server data has arrived (a `synced` flag reset on every change and set again when the props update with nothing pending). Verified in the Contentful project with a headless browser (one click: one update; three quick clicks: a steady climb); the identical file was copied here (it was byte-identical to the old version; `tsc` and `eslint` pass).
