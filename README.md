# Commerce B2B storefront

**Live:** https://contentstack-commerce-b2b.vercel.app (English) and https://contentstack-commerce-b2b.vercel.app/fr (French)

A headless B2B storefront for trade batteries. **Content** (pages, articles, guides, FAQs, navigation, banners) lives in
**Contentstack**; the **catalog, prices and cart** live in **BigCommerce**; **Next.js 16** (App Router) composes them.
The site is bilingual (English at `/`, French at `/fr`) and editors can edit it visually in Contentstack.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node 22+, Python 3.12+ with Pillow (only for the seeding scripts), a Contentstack stack and a BigCommerce
store with a storefront channel.

```bash
cd storefront
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # then fill in the values (see docs/operations.md)
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000   (French: /fr)
```

Common commands:

```bash
npm run dev          # development server (Turbopack)
npm run lint         # ESLint
npx tsc --noEmit     # type-check
npm run build        # production build

# Seed the stack with sample content (idempotent; needs CONTENTSTACK_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN)
python3 scripts/seed/schemas.py      # content types
python3 scripts/seed/seed.py         # authors, 36 posts, blog listing
python3 scripts/seed/seed_extra.py   # FAQs, guides, spotlights, nav, banners, pages
python3 scripts/seed/seed_fr.py      # French versions of everything
```

- [Contentstack](docs/contentstack.md): stack setup, the 10 content types, publishing
- [Live Preview and Visual Editor](docs/live-preview-and-visual-editor.md): live sync and inline editing
- [BigCommerce](docs/bigcommerce.md): channel, token, queries, listing, cart
- [Internationalization](docs/i18n.md): locales, URLs, translation workflow
- [Seeding](docs/seeding.md): sample content scripts
- [Design system](docs/design-system.md): tokens, type, components
- [Operations](docs/operations.md): environment variables, deployment, troubleshooting
- [Decisions](docs/decisions.md): why things are the way they are

## Important notes

- **All sample content is fictional.** Author names, article text, FAQ policies, delivery claims and the
  `example.com` contact details are placeholders. Replace them before going public.
- **Photography** comes from pilesbatteries.com and is used with the owner's permission (text-free images only).
- **Product names and brands are not translated**: they come from BigCommerce, where the store has no French
  translations. Navigation, categories, specs and all UI text are translated.
- The Contentstack stack is on the **free plan** (10 content types maximum, currently all used).
- Secrets live only in `.env.local` (gitignored). The management token is used by the seeding scripts, never by the
  running storefront.
