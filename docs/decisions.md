# Decisions

Short records of the choices that shape the project: what was decided, why, and what was rejected. Newest context last
within each theme.

## Architecture

### D1. Contentstack for content, BigCommerce for commerce; keyed by ID
**Decision.** Editorial content lives in Contentstack; catalog, prices, stock and carts stay in BigCommerce. Content links
to products by **product ID / SKU** (`product_spotlight.bc_product_id`, `buying_guide.recommended_bc_products`), resolved at
request time.
**Why.** Prices and stock must never go stale or be copied into a second system. Deleting a product only removes a card.
**Rejected.** Syncing products into Contentstack (duplication and drift); storing prices in content.

### D2. Server Components first; JavaScript only for interaction
**Decision.** Pages render on the server; a handful of small Client Components (filters, cart, mega menu, gallery, editing
SDK) handle interaction.
**Why.** Fast first paint, simple data flow, and the Live Preview SSR mode works without client-side data fetching.

### D3. Storefront GraphQL, not the REST Management API, for the storefront
**Decision.** Read catalog and run carts through the **Storefront GraphQL API** with a channel-scoped token.
**Why.** It respects channel visibility, customer-group rules and guest pricing, is safe on the server with a narrow
token, and supports faceted search. The Management API (admin token) is for administration only.

## Content model

### D4. Keep FAQ, drop Case Study (the 10-type cap)
**Decision.** The free plan allows 10 content types. When navigation needed a slot, the empty `case_study` type was
deleted and `faq` kept.
**Why.** FAQs answer real buyer questions (credit, delivery, fitment) and are reused by guides; case studies are marketing
content the blog already covers. The type was empty, so nothing was lost.

### D5. UI strings in code, not in Contentstack
**Decision.** Button and label text live in `lib/i18n.ts`.
**Why.** A "UI strings" content type would have used another of the 10 slots. The dictionary is type-checked so a missing
French string is a compile error.
**Consequence.** Editors cannot change UI labels without a developer; marketing copy (heroes, banners, nav) *is* in the CMS.

### D6. Select-field values stay English; display is mapped
**Decision.** FAQ topics, guide audiences and spotlight badges store fixed English values and are translated for display.
**Why.** Contentstack select choices are not localizable.
**Consequence.** Adding a choice means editing the schema and the label maps.

### D7. Category photo tiles are static
**Decision.** The five home-page category tiles use files in `public/images/categories/` with labels from `lib/i18n.ts`.
**Why.** Contentstack had no free content-type slot for them. They match the BigCommerce category tree one-to-one.
**Alternative later.** A `category_tile` type (or reuse `block`) if editors need to change them.

## Internationalization

### D8. English at clean URLs, French under `/fr`; rewrite, not redirect
**Decision.** `proxy.ts` rewrites unprefixed paths to `/en/…` and redirects `/en/…` to the clean URL.
**Why.** Keeps existing URLs stable for the default language while using one `[locale]` route tree.
**Rejected.** `/en` prefix for English (changes all URLs); sub-domains (needs DNS/hosting setup).

### D9. Shared slugs for content; translated URLs for the catalog
**Decision.** Content pages share slugs across languages (`/fr/blog/<english-slug>`). The catalog uses BigCommerce's translated URLs
(`/fr/produits/<categorie>/<produit>`), with a language switcher that looks the page up.
**Why.** For content, the switcher is exact (swap the prefix) and no slug mapping is needed. For the catalog, BigCommerce already translates
and serves the paths, and French URLs are better for SEO and for visitors.
**History.** The catalog first kept English slugs in French (paths restored from the default-language catalog); translated URLs replaced that.

### D10. Fallback to English for untranslated entries
**Decision.** `includeFallback()` on every read.
**Why.** A partially translated site is better than gaps. Missing translations are visible to editors because the page
shows English.

### D11. Product text and URLs come from BigCommerce Store Translations
**Decision.** Do not translate product names, copy or paths in code. Read translated content from the Storefront API with an
`@shopperPreferences(locale: "fr")` directive (it ignores `Accept-Language`) and use the translated paths it returns (see [bigcommerce.md](bigcommerce.md)).
**Why.** Product data belongs to BigCommerce, including its URLs; a translated path only resolves in its own language, so pages resolve the
path of the page's language.
**Consequence.** The catalog root segment per language is configuration (`CATALOG_ROOT`); a language switch on a catalog page costs one
redirect through `/api/switch-locale`; filter values are translated, so attribute filters are not carried across languages.

## Editing

### D12. SSR live preview, not client-side rendering
**Decision.** `ssr: true`: the preview pane re-requests HTML after each edit; the server reads the draft with the hash `proxy.ts` passes on in `x-cs-*` headers.
**Why.** Our pages are Server Components. CSR mode would need client-side data fetching and a parallel rendering path for
every page.
**Trade-off.** Each edit is a server render (slower than CSR), but there is one code path.

### D13. No `setPageContext` call
**Decision.** Do not call `setPageContext`. (The earlier version declared the entry with `contentstack:entry-uid` / `contentstack:content-type-uid` meta tags; the block-model code renders none.)
**Why.** `setPageContext` posts a message that logs an error when there is no Visual Builder to acknowledge it (Timeline
mode). Meta tags are the SDK's documented alternative.

### D14. Edit tags only in preview
**Decision.** `proxy.ts` sets the trusted `x-preview` header only when Live Preview's parameters are present (and removes any such header sent by a client); the mapper adds edit tags only for it (`$` is empty otherwise), and the SDK loads only for preview requests and requests framed by Contentstack's app (`x-editor`).
**Why.** Production HTML should carry no editing markup.

## Catalog

### D15. A category lists its subcategories' products
**Decision.** Category pages use faceted search by `categoryEntityId` rather than `category.products`.
**Why.** Products are assigned to subcategories; the category's own list is empty, which made category pages blank.

### D16. Facets chosen by coverage, capped at 8 values
**Decision.** Brand plus Technology (93% of products), Voltage (89%), Warranty (66%); every facet shows ≤ 8 values and keeps
selected ones visible. Capacity range (54%) and Format (26%) were rejected.
**Why.** A filter that applies to a minority of products misleads. Long value lists (25 technologies) are noise.

### D17. The listing is a GET form that navigates on change
**Decision.** Filters are an HTML `<form method="get">`; JavaScript intercepts changes and calls `router.push` with
`{ scroll: false }`.
**Why.** Every state is a shareable, crawlable URL; it works without JavaScript; there is no client-side filter state to
keep in sync with the server. Chips and clear-all are plain links.
**Details.** Checkbox `key`s include their selected state and the search/price inputs reconcile with the URL, so removing a
chip resets the controls.

### D18. Search starts at 3 characters
**Decision.** Search-as-you-type is debounced (350 ms) and ignores 1–2 characters (with a hint).
**Why.** One or two characters match too broadly and cause needless requests.

## Cart

### D19. Cart state in BigCommerce; hosted checkout
**Decision.** The browser stores only the cart ID in an httpOnly cookie; checkout uses BigCommerce's hosted checkout URL.
**Why.** No payment or PII handling in this app; carts are shared with BigCommerce tooling and persist across devices only
via the cookie (guest carts).

### D20. Optimistic quantity editing
**Decision.** Update totals immediately, save after 500 ms, reconcile with `router.refresh()`. The optimistic subtotal stays on screen
until fresh server data has arrived (a `synced` flag in `CartView`).
**Why.** Quantity buttons feel instant; a failed save shows an error and the next refresh restores the server's numbers. Falling back
to the props as soon as the save ended showed the previous subtotal for a moment (new, old, new), so the flag keeps the optimistic
total until the refreshed props arrive.

## Design

### D21. "Workbench": light, photographic, one accent
**Decision.** Cool steel and ink with terminal amber; Archivo + IBM Plex Sans; open product tiles; 1100 px pages.
**Why.** Fits a trade supplier (practical, legible, photography-led) and avoids the usual generated-site defaults. See
[design-system.md](design-system.md).
**Rejected.** Dark theme; cream with a warm accent; boxed shadowed cards.

### D22. Photography policy
**Decision.** Use only text-free photos from pilesbatteries.com (with the owner's permission); never bake titles into images;
guide heroes use photography, not composed product shots.
**Why.** Titles in images cannot be translated, edited or read by screen readers. Product images come from BigCommerce.

### D23. Amber is never body or heading text on white
**Decision.** Amber is for fills, underlines and rules.
**Why.** Amber on white measures 2.3:1, which fails WCAG. (Step numbers were changed from deep amber to ink after a contrast check.)

## Process

### D24. Idempotent Python seeders instead of manual entry
**Decision.** All sample content is generated from data files and pushed through the Management API.
**Why.** Reproducible, reviewable and re-runnable: schema, English, translations and images can be refreshed together.
**Consequence.** Localized entries are copies, so the scripts must be re-run in order (English first, then French).

### D25. Assets replaced in place
**Decision.** An upload whose filename already exists replaces that asset's file (same UID).
**Why.** Reusing the old file silently ignored updated crops; creating a new asset would orphan every reference.

### D26. All sample content is fictional
**Decision.** Authors, article text, FAQ policies, delivery claims and contact details are placeholders (`example.com`).
**Why.** Nothing in the site should be mistaken for real policy or real people. Replace before launch.

### D27. Review gate: staging site plus a workflow and publishing rule
**Decision.** Edits are published to `preview` and checked on a public staging site (branch `staging`); a Contentstack workflow
(Draft, In review, Approved) with a publishing rule lets only **Approved** entries reach `production`.
**Why.** The gate is enforced by Contentstack, not by habit, and costs nothing on the free plan. A Release was rejected as the
only gate because it does not block a direct publish. **Known limits** (editing an Approved entry keeps its stage, self-approval
with one admin, code is not gated) are listed in [workflow.md](workflow.md).

### D28. Staging is public and rebuilt by an empty commit
**Decision.** Vercel deployment protection is off for previews, and a GitHub Action rebuilds `staging` from `main` with an empty
commit on every push.
**Why.** Contentstack's Live Preview iframe and reviewers need to open the URL without a Vercel login (Vercel adds `noindex`).
Vercel skips a branch whose tip it already built, so the empty commit forces a fresh deployment.

### D29. Pages and posts are ordered lists of blocks
**Decision.** A `page` entry holds `components`, a modular blocks field (`hero`, `feature`, `text`, `image`, `video`, `collection`); a post
(`blog_landing_page`) holds `content` blocks (text, image, video) and `read_time`. One generic `collection` block, with a `kind` (`categories`,
`spotlights`, `guides`, `posts`, `postListing`, `guideListing`, `faqs`) and `items` references, covers every list-like section. The blog index is a
`page` entry (url `/blog`) instead of `blog_listing_page`, and `getPage(key)` reads the entry whose `url` is `/<key>`; `app/[locale]/[...slug]` renders any
such page.
**Why.** Editors can reorder, add and remove components without a developer, as in the Amplience version, and one model serves every CMS of the
switchable project. The blocks live in the entry, so Visual Editor edits one in place.
**Consequence.** The catalog moved to a static `products` route, with translated roots rewritten by `proxy.ts` (`x-catalog-root`), to leave the
catch-all route free. The 10-type cap is relieved (the prune removed two types).

### D30. Single-CMS build on the shared model
**Decision.** The UI, `core/`, the proxy and the provider come from `content-commerce-b2b` reduced to Contentstack: `lib/content.ts` is a facade over
`providers/cms/contentstack/{client,mapper,index,live-preview,edit-support}`. `lib/blog.ts`, `lib/site.ts`, `lib/cslp.ts` and `lib/rte.ts`
are gone. The seeding scripts moved from `scripts/seed` to `tools/contentstack`.
**Why.** Same UI and model on every CMS, with one place (the provider) that knows Contentstack.

### D31. Earlier fixed-layout model kept until a prepared prune, then pruned (7 October 2026)
**Decision.** The block fields were added next to the earlier model (`blocks.py` is additive) and the site was switched to read only the new one. The old
fields (`page.image`, `rich_text`, `blocks`, `hero`; `blog_landing_page.body`, `related_post`, `is_archived`, `comments`, `social_share`) and the
`blog_listing_page` and `hero_banner` types stayed in the stack until the prune.
**Why.** Nothing is removed while the live site can still depend on it. `tools/contentstack/prune.py` removes them (a dry run unless `--run`, after `backup.py`);
it was run on 7 October 2026 after a backup, once the block-model code was deployed and its content published to `preview` and `production`.
**Result.** Production and staging were verified after the prune (home, FAQ, guides, blog, English and French).

## Open questions

- Will buyers **sign in** (B2B Edition companies, price lists, quotes)? Today "your negotiated prices" is aspirational copy.
- Should attribute filters survive a language switch (their values are translated, so they are dropped today)?
- Should category tiles and the home category mosaic move into Contentstack? (They are now a `collection` block of kind `categories`, but the tiles are still static files.)
- Publish **webhooks and caching** for Contentstack reads at production traffic.
