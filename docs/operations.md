# Operations

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and npm (the project is built and tested on Node 24).
- Python 3.12+ with Pillow for the seeding scripts (optional for running the site).
- A Contentstack stack (delivery + preview tokens; management token for seeding) and a BigCommerce store with a
  storefront channel and a Storefront API token.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. **All are server-side**; none use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CONTENTSTACK_API_KEY` | yes | stack API key |
| `CONTENTSTACK_DELIVERY_TOKEN` | yes | read-only token for the environment below |
| `CONTENTSTACK_PREVIEW_TOKEN` | for preview | lets Live Preview read unsaved/draft content |
| `CONTENTSTACK_ENVIRONMENT` | yes | environment name; must be the environment the delivery token is bound to (`preview` today) |
| `CONTENTSTACK_REGION` | yes | `us`, `eu`, `au`, `azure-na`, `azure-eu` or `gcp-na` (`eu` today) |
| `CONTENTSTACK_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN` | seeding only | write access; **never** needed to run the site |
| `BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH` | yes | store hash |
| `BIGCOMMERCE_CHANNEL_ID` | yes | channel ID of the headless storefront channel |
| `BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_TOKEN` | yes | channel-scoped Storefront API token (one allowed origin) |

`.env.local` is gitignored. Do not paste token values into chats, tickets or commit messages.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000 (English), http://localhost:3000/fr (French)
```

After changing `next.config.ts`, `proxy.ts` or `.env.local`, **restart the dev server**.

Checks:

```bash
npx next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit   # types (typegen refreshes route helper types)
npm run lint
npm run build                          # production build
```

## Routine tasks

| Task | How |
|---|---|
| Change copy, FAQs, guides, banners, nav, or the order of a page's components | Contentstack, then **publish** to `preview` (both locales) |
| Refresh sample content | [seeding.md](seeding.md) |
| Add a UI string | `lib/i18n.ts` (English and French) |
| Rotate the BigCommerce token | create a new token for the origin, update the variable, redeploy; old ones expire by themselves |
| Check live preview | open an entry in Contentstack → Live Preview, or Visual Experience (the proxy marks the editor's frame with `x-editor`, see [live-preview-and-visual-editor.md](live-preview-and-visual-editor.md)) |

### Renewing the BigCommerce Storefront token

The current token expires in **January 2027**. Create a new one for each origin you serve
(`POST /v3/storefront/api-token` with `channel_id`, `expires_at` and a single `allowed_cors_origins` entry), update
`BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_TOKEN`, and redeploy. A stale token shows up as empty product sections and `[bigcommerce] … failed`
messages in the server log.

## Production deployment (Vercel)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| URL | https://contentstack-commerce-b2b.vercel.app |
| Vercel project | `contentstack-commerce-b2b` (scope "Rza Kalfane's projects") |
| Source | GitHub `rezakalfane/contentstack-commerce-b2b`, branch `main` |
| Deploys | every push to `main` deploys to production; the `staging` branch (rebuilt from `main` by a GitHub Action) deploys the staging site; other branches and pull requests get preview deployments |
| Staging | https://contentstack-commerce-b2b-git-staging-rza-kalfanes-projects.vercel.app, reads the `preview` environment, public (deployment protection off for previews, `noindex`). See [workflow.md](workflow.md) |
| Variables | the 8 storefront variables, in Production and Preview scopes (tokens marked *sensitive*); **no management token**. **Production** reads Contentstack's `production` environment with its own delivery and preview tokens; **Preview** reads `preview` |

What was verified on the live site: English and French pages, live BigCommerce prices and facet counts, product pages,
the 308 redirect from `/en/…`, the `frame-ancestors` header, every image (Contentstack and BigCommerce hosts), and the
full cart flow (add, change quantity, persistence after reload, hosted-checkout link, remove).

**The BigCommerce token worked from Vercel even though it was created for `http://localhost:3000`.** The allowed-origin
setting governs browser (CORS) requests; server-to-server calls carry no `Origin` header. Creating a token per environment
is still the tidier practice (separate expiry and revocation), but it is not required for this server-rendered storefront.

**After the first deploy, in Contentstack** add the production Live Preview base URLs for both locales
(`https://contentstack-commerce-b2b.vercel.app` and `https://contentstack-commerce-b2b.vercel.app/fr`), see
[live-preview-and-visual-editor.md](live-preview-and-visual-editor.md).

### Redeploying and changing variables

```bash
git push origin main                                   # deploys production automatically
vercel deploy --prod --scope rza-kalfanes-projects     # or deploy from your machine
printf '%s' "$VALUE" | vercel env add NAME production --sensitive --yes --scope rza-kalfanes-projects
vercel env ls --scope rza-kalfanes-projects            # names and scopes only
```

Changing a variable needs a redeploy to take effect.

## Deployment checklist for any host

1. Set every variable above in the hosting project (Production and Preview scopes). Do **not** set the management token.
2. Create a BigCommerce Storefront token whose allowed origin is the **production domain**; use it in production.
3. In Contentstack: add the production base URLs for **both locales** in Live Preview settings
   (`https://your-domain` and `https://your-domain/fr`).
4. The CSP `frame-ancestors` rule (set per request by `proxy.ts`) already allows Contentstack's editors.
5. Next.js on Vercel needs no extra config. `proxy.ts` runs on the Node.js runtime.

### Production readiness checklist

Already done: deployed on Vercel with GitHub auto-deploy and all variables set (see above).

- [x] A **`production`** environment exists in Contentstack, with Live Preview base URLs for both locales on the Vercel domain.
- [x] All content is published to `production`; the live site reads it with its own delivery and preview tokens
      ([contentstack.md](contentstack.md#environments-and-tokens)). Confirm with the `X-Content-Environment` response header.
- [x] Review gate between `preview` and `production`: staging site plus workflow and publishing rule ([workflow.md](workflow.md)).
- [x] **Deploy the block-model code** and verify production and staging (home, FAQ, guides, blog, a post, a guide, English and French, and an edit in Visual Editor).
- [x] **Run the prune** of the earlier fixed-layout fields and the `blog_listing_page` / `hero_banner` types (`backup.py`, deploy, then `prune.py --run`; see [seeding.md](seeding.md#backup-and-prune)). Done on 7 October 2026.
- [ ] Editors: follow the routine in [workflow.md](workflow.md#the-editor-routine); turn on *Prevent self-approval* once there is a second approver.
- [ ] Replace all fictional sample content (authors, article text, FAQ policies, promotions, contact details).
- [ ] Add **publish webhooks** → Next.js revalidation (tags or paths), then cache Contentstack reads.
- [ ] Decide the B2B account story: customer login, company price lists, quotes ([bigcommerce.md](bigcommerce.md)).
- [ ] `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, canonical host, analytics, error monitoring.
- [ ] Review the cookie notice requirements for the cart cookie (`bc_cart_id`, strictly necessary).
- [ ] Run the checks (tsc, lint, build) and a manual pass on EN and FR: home, listing, product, cart, blog, guides, FAQ.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Pages render without images | image host not allowed | `images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts`, then restart |
| Empty product sections, `[bigcommerce] … failed` in the log | expired/wrong Storefront token, wrong channel host, origin mismatch | see "Renewing the token" |
| `api_key is not valid` | wrong `CONTENTSTACK_REGION` | set the region of the stack |
| Content changes not visible | not published to the environment, or the French entry is a stale copy | publish; re-run `seed_fr.py` |
| A page is 404 but its entry exists | the page key is the entry's `url` (`/faq` is key `faq`), and the entry must be published in that locale | set the `url` on a `page` entry with `components`, and publish it |
| French page shows English text | no `fr-fr` version (fallback) or a UI string is missing | translate the entry / add the string |
| `Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components` | a callback prop from a Server Component | pass data (strings), not functions |
| Product page 404 | the BigCommerce path is not on the channel, or the product is not visible | check the product's channel assignment and visibility |
| Cart badge lags | the header reads the cart after the action revalidates (~1 s) | expected |
| Live Preview errors | see [live-preview-and-visual-editor.md](live-preview-and-visual-editor.md) | |
| `Cannot find module` after moving files | stale `.next` | stop the server, delete `.next`, restart |

## Logs and diagnostics

- Server logs include `[bigcommerce] … failed: <message>` and `[cart] … failed` lines. These are the first place to look.
- `curl -s -X POST https://store-<hash>-<channel>.mybigcommerce.com/graphql -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" …`
  reproduces any GraphQL call.
- Contentstack: `GET https://eu-cdn.contentstack.com/v3/content_types?environment=preview` with `api_key` and
  `access_token` headers lists published content types.

## Known limitations

- No buyer sign-in, per-company pricing, quotes or order history (B2B Edition is not yet integrated).
- Product, category and custom-field text is translated only where BigCommerce has Store Translations (French, plus any other locale added the same way).
- Contentstack reads are not cached by Next.js (each request reads the CDN).
- The stack still holds the earlier fixed-layout fields and types next to the block model until the prepared prune is run; the free plan's 10 content types stay all in use until then.
- The review gate covers content only, not code; editing an Approved entry does not reset its stage ([workflow.md](workflow.md#what-the-gate-does-not-cover)).
- The Contentstack free plan allows 10 content types; all are in use.
- Search on the blog is a simple in-memory text match over the posts listed (at most 100).
